5. To which complexity class does the following algorithm belong?
	public static void mystery2(int[] list) {
    for (int i = 0; i < list.length / 2; i++) {
        int j = list.length – 1 – i;
        int temp = list[i];
        list[i] = list[j];
        list[j] = temp;
    }
}

A. Linear or O(N) since algorithms have runtimes that are directly proportional to N as well as because the loop repeats
roughly N/2 times, and the operations in the loop belong to the O(N) time complexity class
